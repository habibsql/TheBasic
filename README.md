# TheDataStructures

Data Structures are nothing but data organization/management/storeage formats.Various types of data strucutres exists. 
Based on the context different data structures are used. Various data structures are support various operations. 

## Types of Data Structures

Their performaces are also varied. For example, Some data structures read operation is first but write is slow. Some are 
better for accessing particular element farster but navigation of particular critera is slow. Based on the context with 
algorithms the datastructures need to be selected.

## Data Structures Big-O

It is very important to understand the performance of data structures and its operations. Time complexity & Space complexity 
are two important critera for analysis. Algorithm performace is depends on proper data structure selection. So it is very
vital part of any algorithm. Every algorithm works with data and to manage/store/handle that data, the data structure is must.
