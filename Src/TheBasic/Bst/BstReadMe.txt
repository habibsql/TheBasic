Bst -> Binary Search Tree

A special Kind of tree which properties are

1) Every Node at most 2 child node.
2) It is okay if 0 or 1 child node exists.
3) Left child node should contain less than or equal of its parent node value.
4) Right child node should contain greater than of its parent value.

The time complexity of BST
Worst case:
* Searching/Insertion/Deletion : O(h)  -> h is the height of the tree
* Height = no of edges from root node to its deepest leaf node.


2 types of tree traversals are there:
1) Dept First
    i) Inorder ii) Pre Order iii) PostOrder

2) Breath First
