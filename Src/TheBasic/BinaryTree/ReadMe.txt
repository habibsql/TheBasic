- Special kind of Non linear Tree data structure
- Every Node has atmost 2 children & finite set of nodes.
- Every node contains i) left node and ii) right node (Left child/Right child)
- Tree connections called its branches.


- Various types of Binary Tree:
   i) Full/proper/strict: Each node is contain either 0 or 2 children. It is also comple binary tree.
   ii) Complete: Except Last level, every node has exact 2 children. For last level nodes, left sides fill first. 
   iii) Balanced/Avl: Detail in avl section.
   iv) Degenarate: All the internal nodes are having 1 child
   v) Perfect: All the internal nodes are having 2 children and all leaf nodes are same level.

 - Properties:
    - Height h with no missing node.
    - All leaves are at level h other nodes has max 2 children.
    

- Advantages:
 - Searching become faster
 - Maximum & minimum can be directly picked up.
