- Linear data structure.
- Consist of serise of connected nodes.
- Each node contains 2 parts i) Data part ii) Pointer/address to its next node.
- Arrays are static structure & linklist is dynamic structure.


1. Single Link list : 
	- Common link list. It is default. Only contain data part and only address of next node. 
2. Double Link list:
	- Contain data part and 2 address, 1 for previous node another for next node.
3. Cirlular link list:
	- Same as singly link list only last node (tail node) contain the referense of first/head node.
4. Doble Link list:
	- Same as doubly link list. last node contains its head node pointer and head node contain last node in previous node address space.


- Applications:
	- Dynamic memory allocation
	- Use to create ADT like Stack, Queue, Hashtable, Graph
	

- Performace
	- Insert/Delete time complexity O(1)
	- Read O(n)


- Disadvantages:
	- Memory waste as pointer required extra memory storage.
	- Element cannot be accessed randomly. Only sequential access is possible.
