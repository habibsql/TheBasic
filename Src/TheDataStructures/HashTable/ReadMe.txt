- Data structure store data as key/value pair.
- Many times it called as Dictionay.
- Implement as associative array
- Key is converted as integer using Hash function to optimize lookup.
- Keyes must be unique and cannot be null.


- Hashing: Searching technique.
	- Open Hashing (Closed addressing)
	- Closed Hashing (Open addression)


- Performace:
	- Time complexity:
		- Search O(n)
		- Add/Delete O(1)
		- Access a particular item O(1)


- Applications:
	- Use to create many types of inmemory table. They are used to implement associative array.
	- Use to implement cache.
	- Many languages like javascript use hashtable for object.
	- Hash functions are used in various algorithms to make their computing faster.


- Operations:
	- Add value
	- Remove value
	- Get Value using key
